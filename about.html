			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				I recently wrapped up my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at 
				The University of Utah where I am also currently a software engineering intern.
			</p>

			<p>
				At my internship I work on web applications that are used by students and faculty.
				Languages I regularly use at my job are Java, Kotlin, HTML, SQL, and JavaScript.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although my work experience keeps me close to the JVM, my favorite programming language 
				is C. However, I like to work in all kinds of languages and have been looking to brush up on
				Python or learn a new language. I also love to use Linux and am coziest when using i3 and Vim
				(or an editor with Vim keybindings).
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that I'm finished with my degree, I'm looking forward to applying my skills in a more
				professional capacity as well as exploring personal projects and hobbies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of CS and programming, some things I enjoy are skiing, reading, making music,
				and playing video games.
