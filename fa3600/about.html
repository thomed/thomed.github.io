        	This interactive experience by Thomas Walker was done for a class at the University of Utah.<br /><br />
          It puts you in the (fictional) shoes of a hacker from the 1980s.
          This was a time when hackers were feared, in part due to movies like WarGames.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not 100% accurate.<br />
          For example, the terminal window is based off of more modern shells and was
          designed to be accessible to those not overly familiar with a command-line.

        <p>
          To be clear, no one is actually connecting to your computer and all code is
          being run on your machine.
