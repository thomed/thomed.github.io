                &emsp;In 1969, the first computer terminal reminiscent of modern devices entered production. The Datapoint 3300 was intended to emulate console typewriters, displaying text on a screen rather than paper as the user typed on the attached keyboard. The screen displayed the now classic, or even forgotten, monochromatic green text on a black background. This remained the most common color scheme many years, though some terminals used amber or orange in place of green. Still high-contrast, these simple color schemes represent the utilitarian functions of a command line interface.

                &emsp;Although no longer the norm when interacting with a computer, command line interfaces very much still exist in modern computers, generally in the form of an emulator. However, no longer limited by technology or hardware, the colors and layout of these terminal command line emulators offer many customization options. Modern computer displays are capable of displaying over 16.6 million different colors. Though using high-contrasting colors is generally still favorable in terminal emulators, many users opt to customize them as more of display of personality or character than for optimal utility.
