	&emsp;One of the earliest commercial computers to provide realtime visual feedback based on user input and output was the Universal Automatic Computer 1 (UNIVAC 1), which was delivered to the first customer in 1951. This 29,000 pound, 5,200 vacuum tube behemoth had enough memory to hold about twenty 10-character words. Although famous for being used to accurately predict Dwight D. Eisenhowerâ€™s victory over Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election, using the UNIVAC 1 would be an extremely convoluted and unfamiliar process compared to what we use today.

                &emsp;The UNIVAC 1 used a keyboard and console typewriter along with dozens of switches switches on a panel to enter data and send instructions to the computer. As data was processed, the colored lights scattered across the black switch-panel flickered and information printed from the console typewriter. Used solely for calculating and producing information, these simple, high-contrast responses did everything that an early computer interface needed to do. These types of interfaces were used until the late 1960s.
