                &emsp;With the progression of technology and the realization of science-fiction ideas, we are starting to gain an idea of what the future of human-computer interaction might hold for us. As human-computer interaction starts to become more like human-computer integration, technology will likely attempt to compensate for the mundanities of everyday life. Colors will certainly play a role in this process.

            <p class="primary-text"> 
                &emsp;Below is an interesting representation of many theories for human-computer interaction in the not-too-distant future. Worth watching if you have the time.

                &emsp;Disregarding the narrative of this video, the overstimulation and saturation of the colors seem very powerful and distracting. 
                This is consistent with the usage of color over time as technology has progressed. We are so immersed by colors that they seem to
                be losing their effectiveness.
